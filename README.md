# project-structure-front-end-

This assessment includes building a small React project. To help get you started, here’s a YouTube tutorial on building a simple React project that will guide you through setting up a basic project structure. For submission, you’ll be creating a project folder with organized files and submitting either a .zip file or a link to your hosted repository.

The assessment is designed to be manageable, with an estimated time of 3 to 4 hours to complete all tasks. Each task focuses on specific skills essential to the course.


HTML & CSS Fundamentals:
Task 1:
Write an HTML page with the following:

A heading with the text "Product List".
An unordered list (<ul>) with at least 3 list items representing products (e.g., "Apple", "Banana", "Orange").
Style the page with CSS to:
Center the heading on the page.
Make the list items bold and green.
Add a 1px border to the list and set the list’s background color to light gray.

JavaScript Fundamentals:
Task 2: 
You are given an array of numbers. Write a function that calculates the total sum and the average of the numbers using the reduce method.
Task 3:
You are given an array of strings, some of which may be duplicates. Write a function that removes all duplicates from the array in constant time complexity and returns the array with unique values.  


TypeScript Basics:
Task 4: 
Create a TypeScript interface for a Product with the following properties:

name: string
price: number
Write a function that:

Accepts an array of Product objects.
Returns the total price of all products.

Task 5: 
Write a TypeScript function that accepts a string and checks if it is a valid email address. You can assume the email should have a basic structure like username@domain.com. Use regular expressions to implement this.  

Submission Instructions: 
Project Structure: Create a folder named assignment to contain all your project files. Inside this folder, organize your files as follows: index.html for the HTML page corresponding to Task 1, style.css for the CSS styling, script.js for the JavaScript code handling Tasks 2 and 3, and product.ts for the TypeScript code for Tasks 4 and 5.  


Code and Documentation: Ensure that each task is clearly marked with comments in your code (e.g., // Task 1, // Task 2, etc.). In the product.ts file, include a brief explanation of how the TypeScript code works and any necessary instructions on how to run it, such as compiling TypeScript to JavaScript.
Submission: Once all tasks are complete, compress the entire assignment folder into a .zip file containing all the necessary files. If you're using a version control system like Git, you can also provide a link to your GitHub repository or any other platform where your project is hosted.
